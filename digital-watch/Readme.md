We need to make some variables to keep track of the time and for a few other things.
1. Go into Basic in the toolbox and pull an on start on to the workspace.
2. Ok, in Variables click on Make a Variable. Name the variable as hours. Drag out a set to block and change the name with the dropdown to hours. Place the variable into the on start block.
