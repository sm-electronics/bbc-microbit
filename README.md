Installing
Board Manager

    Download and install the Arduino IDE (At least v1.6.12)
    Start the Arduino IDE
    Go into Preferences
    Add https://sandeepmistry.github.io/arduino-nRF5/package_nRF5_boards_index.json as an "Additional Board Manager URL"
    Open the Boards Manager from the Tools -> Board menu and install "Nordic Semiconductor nRF5 Boards"
